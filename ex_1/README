Patron.java - implements the Patron class.
Book.java - implements the Book class.



=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the Library class in a way that it can hold a static amount of placeholders for books,
and registered patrons.Unless books and panelist were supplied ,the library placeholders point to null.
The Book class was implemented according to the given skeleton.The  Patron class was also implemented
in according to the API with the addition of a field to hold the total of books currently held by a given patron .



=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the Library class, in order to store the books and patrons that are registered ,
I chose to use arrays of Book and Patron type because the total number of each is limited by the library capacity for
books and registered panelist.I also used a counter for the total borrowed books for making sure that the
amount does not exceed the Libraries' limit.
Also I added a int field to count the total amount of borrowed books a patron holds in a given time.
